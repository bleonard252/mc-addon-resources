Minecraft UI.json Documentation

Docs are in the Wiki. Contribute what you want to using Issues: start with `[Edit]` (for direct edit suggestions, i.e. `change "jason" to "json"`) or `[Suggestion]` (for ideas with contents, i.e. `this type exists`).

NOTE: There is some official documentation now for this. Soon, HTML5-based GUIs can be created! This repository will stay around for the JSON-based UI documentation and some boilerplates and examples for Minecraft GUIs and other addons.
